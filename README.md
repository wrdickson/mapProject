###Map Project

This my iteration of a map viewer, editor, downloader using the Google Maps API v3.

A rickety, spaghetti-coded alpha is at http://www.mytrail.org/jMap

I'm trying to pull out all the guns here: Backbone routers, views, and models; Marionette application and views; RESTful api; an application event channel, require.js modules, r.js optimization.  It's my first attempt at something professional and scalable.
